/*

To add a new linter simply add a new function to the exports object. It will
get passed 3 arguments:

    * path: the full path to the file
    * source: the contents of the file
    * jshint: the jshint.data() object

The linters must return `false` if there are no problems, or an array of
objects if there are. The objects must have the following properties:

    * line: the line number where the problem is
    * problem: a statement of the problem
    * solution: what the developer can do to fix the problem. Use backquotes (`)
      around code snippets that the developer can use
