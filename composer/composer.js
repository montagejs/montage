 * @classdesc A `Composer` abstracts a pattern of DOM events, emitting more useful, higher-level events. 
 * This helps to keep event normalization and calculation out of specific `Component`s and in a reusable place.
 * For example, the `TranslateComposer` handles listening to different mouse and touch events that represent
 * dragging, and emits common `translate` events with helpful information about the move. 
 *
 * Specific composersshould specialize this `Composer` class and implement the `load` and `unload` methods to 
 * attach and remove their event listeners. Subclasses can also implement `frame` if they need access to their 
 * component's draw cycle.
