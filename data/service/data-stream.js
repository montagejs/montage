/**
 * A [DataProvider]{@link DataProvider} whose data is received sequentially.
 * A DataStream is also a [promise]{@linkcode external:Promise} which is
 * fulfilled when all the data it expects has been received.
 *
 * Objects receiving data from a stream will use its
 * [data]{@link DataStream#data} property to access that data. Alternatively
 * they can use its [then()]{@link DataStream#then} method to get that data or
 * to handle errors, or its [catch()]{@link DataStream#catch} method to handle
 * errors.
 *
 * Objects feeding data to a stream will use its
 * [addData()]{@link DataStream#addData} method to add that data and its
 * [dataDone()]{@link DataStream#dataDone} method to indicate that all available
 * data has been added or its [dataError()]{@link DataStream#dataError} method
 * to indicate an error occurred.
 *
 * Objects can either receive data from a stream or add data to it, but not
 * both. Additionally, only one object can ever add data to a particular
 * stream. Typically that object will be a [Service]{@link DataService}.
 *
 * Each stream is also a [promise]{@linkcode external:Promise} that becomes
 * fulfilled when all the data expected for it is first received and
 * [dataDone()]{@link DataStream#dataDone} is called, or rejected when an
 * error is first encountered and [dataError()]{@link DataStream#dataError}
 * is called. Each such promise is fulfilled or rejected only once and will
 * not be fulfilled or rejected again if the stream's data changes or if an
 * error is encountered subsequently for any reason.
