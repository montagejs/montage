     * data is designed to carry the "meat" of an operation's specifics. For a create, it would be all properties
     * of a new object (I'm assuming a create operation is modeling only 1 object's creation).
     * For an update, it has to carry the new values, but also including values replaced,
     * or the values of some key properties that are considered important for the integrity/unicity of an object.
     *
     * Besides new/soon-to-be-previous-values for cardinality:1 properties, relationships (cardinality:n)
     * modifications should additionally support add/remove | (plus/minus in our range change callbacks)
     * on top of replace.  If we use a single DataOperation class for all operation types, this property may
     * end up having various format depending on the operation's type (CRUD,Lock, RPC...)
     *
     * This property also touches on the difference between object-level operation and raw-data operations.
