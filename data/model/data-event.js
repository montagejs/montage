 *
 * DataEvents:
 *
 * - the target is an objectDescriptor
 *
 *  A DataService facilitates events sent by DataObjects (DOs) at key points in their life cycle:
 *  - create: A DO has been created.
 *  - editstart: User has started to edit a DO.
 *  - edit: A DO has been modifed by the user. Sent when the first change is made from a saved/stable state.
 *  - change: A DO's property has been changed by the user. This isn't unique to DOs and happing in montage on-demand, and part of biding infrastructure.
 *  - update: A local DO's property has been changed, and saved, by another user, pushed by the server side.
 *  - editcancel: User stopped editing a A DataObject (DO) without saving the changes (this would ends up sending a revert as
 *  an object should never leave an editing state without a clear decision about changes made? What about if offline?)
 *  - editend: User has stopped editing a DataObject (DO) ?
 *  - revert: A DataObject's (DO) state has been returned to it's most recent state. / reset?
 *  - validate
 *  - validateerror
 *  - save: A DataObject's (DO) changes have been saved.
 *  - saveerror: A DataObject's (DO) changes have been saved.
 *  - delete: A DataObject's (DO) has been deleted.
 *  - deleteerror: A DataObject's (DO) has been deleted.
