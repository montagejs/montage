/**
 *    Applications that allow end-user operations can use an UndoManager to record
 *    information on how to undo those operations.
 *
 *    ## Undoable Operations
 *
 *    To make an operation undoable an application simply adds the inverse of that
 *    operation to an UndoManager instance using the ```add``` method:
 *
 *    ```undoManager.register(label, operationPromise)```
 *
 *    This means that every undo-able user operation has to have an inverse
 *    operation available. For example a calculator might provide a ```subtract```
 *    method as the inverse of the ```add``` method.
 *
 *    An simple example would look something like this:
 *
 *```javascript
 *add: {
 *       value: function (number) {
 *           this.undoManager.register("Add", Promise.resolve([this.subtract, this, number]));
 *           var result = this.total += number;
 *           return result;
 *       }
 *   },
 *
 *subtract: {
 *       value: function (number) {
 *           this.undoManager.register("Subtract", Promise.resolve([this.add, this, number]));
 *           var result = this.total -= number;
 *           return result;
 *       }
 *   }
 *```
 *
 *    Of immediate interest is the actual promise added to the undoManager.
 *    ```Promise.resolve(["Add", this.subtract, this, number])```
 *
 *    The promise provides the final label (optionally), a reference to the function to call,
 *    the context for the function to be executed in, and any number of arguments
 *    to be passed along when calling the function.
 *
 *    In simple cases such as this the promise for the inverse operation
 *    can be resolved immediately; this is not necessarily always possible in cases
 *    where the operation itself is asynchronous.
 *
 *    ## Basic Undoing and Redoing
 *
 *    After performing ```calculator.add(42)``` the undoManager will have an entry
 *    on how to undo that addition operation. Each operation added to the
 *    undoManager is added on top of a stack. Calling the undoManager's ```undo```
 *    method will perform the operation on the top of that stack if
 *    original operationPromise has been resolved.
 *
 *    While performing an undo operation any additions to the undoManager will
 *    instead be placed on the redo stack. Conversely, any additions made while
 *    performing a redo operation will be placed on the undo stack.
 *
 *    When not actively undoing or redoing, the redo stack is cleared whenever a
 *    new operation is added; the only way operations end up on the redo stack is
 *    through undoing an operation.
 *
 *    ## Asynchronous Considerations
 *
 *    It is possible for a user invoked operation to take some time to complete or
 *    details of how to undo the operation may not be known until the operation
 *    has completed.
 *
 *    In these cases it is important to remember that the undo stack captures user
 *    intent, which is considered synchronous. This is why the undoManager accepts
 *    promises for the operations but places them on the stack synchronously.
 *
 *    Consider the following example:
 *```javascript
 *addRandomNumber: {
 *       var deferredUndo,
 *           self = this;
 *
 *       this.undoManager.register("Add Random", deferredUndo.promise);
 *
 *       return this.randomNumberGeneratorService.next().then(function(rand) {
 *           deferredUndo.resolve(["Add " + rand, self.subtract, self, rand];
 *           var result = self.total = self.total + number;
 *           return result
 *       });
 *   }
 *```
 *
 *    Here we see that the undo operation for addRandomNumber is added to the
 *    UndoManager before we even know how to undo the operation, indeed it's added
 *    before the operation has even happened.
 *
 *    It is worth noting that the undoManager does not block anything. Users are
 *    still free to call ```add```, ```subtract```, ```addRandomNumber``` or any
 *    other APIs exposed by the calculator, whether the ```addRandomNumber``` has
 *    resolved or not. It's the responsibility of an API provider to handle this
 *    scenario as necessary.
 *
 *    At this point two things can happen:
 *    1) A user could invoke ```undo``` after the operation promise's resolution.
 *    2) A user could invoke ```undo``` prior to the operation promise's resolution.
 *
 *    In the first scenario, things move along much like they did in the first case
 *    we described above.
 *
 *    In the second scenario, the undoManager puts the unresolved promise into a
 *    queue of operations to be performed when possible. Subsequent undo and redo
 *    requests are added to this queue.
 *
 *    Whenever a promise is resolved the undoManager runs through this queue in
 *    order, oldest to newest, and attempts to perform the operation specified,
 *    stopping when it encounters an unfulfilled operation promise.
 *
 *    This guarantees that promised operations are added in the order as they were
 *    performed by the user and are executed, not in the order they are fulfilled,
 *    but in the order they are undone or redone.
