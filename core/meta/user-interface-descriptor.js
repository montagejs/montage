/*

List of PropertyInterfaceDescriptors, to show in UI, if not there, it's not viewable
PropertyInspector:
ViewInspector
EditInspector

Javier: per object, a limited amount of metadata:
1 inspector, 1 creator, 1 inlineInspector,


Javier want to be able to define which columns should be used in a table, the ratio of sizes between columns, the sorted by defaults, the filter criteria, etcâ€¦

if a user resize a column, where does it get saved?
The table would ask the object what does it has for a table.

Needs groups of properties, like in objectDescriptor

When serializing their states, a table view that is data driven, the user tweaks needs to be  stored by component unique id and by the type they displayed at the time of change
