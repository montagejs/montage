This is a CommonJS module system, highly compatible with NodeJS,
intended for front-end development of web applications using npm style
packages. It is designed to be automatically replaced by the Montage
Optimizer with a smaller, faster and bundled production module system.

Mr is installed as a package in your application using npm:

```bash
$ npm init                  # if you don't already have a package.json
$ npm install --save mr
```

In an HTML file next to your `package.json` add the Mr script and provide a
module to load:

```html
<script src="node_modules/mr/bootstrap.js" data-module="index"></script>
```

Start writing your code in `index.js`, using the `require` function as you
would in Node. Have a look at the [demo](https://github.com/montagejs/mr/tree/master/demo)
for working example.

You can place your `package.json` in a different location, or avoid having one
at all, with other [script tag attributes](https://github.com/montagejs/mr/tree/master/docs/Script-attributes.md).

## Optimization

Take a look at [Mop, the Montage Optimizer](https://github.com/montagejs/mop)
to optimize applications for production. The optimizer can bundle packages with
all of the dependent modules, can preload bundles of progressive enhancements
in phases, and can generate HTML5 application cache manifests.

## Documentation

Mr is [compatible with Node and npm](https://github.com/montagejs/mr/tree/master/docs/Node-compatability.md), although
there are some differences.

There is documentation for:

 - [`package.json` properties](https://github.com/montagejs/mr/tree/master/docs/Package-API.md)
 - [`require` function](https://github.com/montagejs/mr/tree/master/docs/Require-API.md)
 - [`module` object](https://github.com/montagejs/mr/tree/master/docs/Module-API.md)
 - [The package `config` object](https://github.com/montagejs/mr/tree/master/docs/Config-API.md)

And you may be interested in an in-depth look at [how Mr works](https://github.com/montagejs/mr/tree/master/docs/How-it-works.md).

## Compatibility

At present, Mr depends on `document.querySelector` and
probably several other recent EcmaScript methods that might not be
available in legacy browsers.  With your help, I intend to isolate and
fix these bugs.

At time of writing, tests pass in Chrome 21, Safari 5.1.5, and Firefox
13 on Mac OS 10.6.


## Maintenance

Tests are in the `spec` directory. Use `npm test` to run the tests in
NodeJS or open `spec/run.html` in a browser. 

To run the tests in your browser, simply use `npm run test:jasmine`.

To run the tests using Karma use `npm run test:karma` and for continious tests run with file changes detection `npm run test:karma-dev`.
